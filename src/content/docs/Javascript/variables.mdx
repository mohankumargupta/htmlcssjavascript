## var vs let vs const

1. javascript is an old technology.
2. variables used to be declared with the **var** keyword.
3. Today, **var** is considered bad practice, although you will see it in old code and tutorials.
4. The "modern" way is to use **const** and **let**
5. **const** means the variable can't change once assigned.
6. **let** allows you to reassign values to variables.
7. It is advised to start with **const**, then switch to **let** if you need to reassign.
