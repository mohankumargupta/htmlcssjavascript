1. A webpage is edited with a **HTML document**.

2. The document is of type **HTML5** document.

3. HTML/CSS/Javascript have been around since the 90s 

4. **HTML5** is the successor to previous HTML versions. Browsers still support the old versions,
so that have to be told this is HTML version 5, the latest and greatest. 


## Minimal HTML 5 document

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p> This html document is missing a head element, thats OK.<p>
    <p> The DOCTYPE html declaration tells 
        the browser this is a HTML 5 document</p>
    
</body>
</html>
```

## HTML 5 document with HEAD

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <title>Hello World Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p> Now has head element <p>
</body>
</html>
```
